# Optimizing-Classroom-Utilization-at-Local-University


The purpose of this case study is to offer recommendations for optimizing classroom portfolios at a local university in the Bay Area. This university has a diverse array of classrooms that vary in size, capacity, configuration, condition, and intended use. We analyzed the data using Excel and conducted exploratory analysis, along with visualizations in Python, to examine the provided dataset. This analysis aims to uncover insights and develop strategies that will enhance classroom utilization at the college.

Dataset:

1. Room Number
2. Department (this is the department that owns and manages the space)
3. Room capacity (the maximum number of student seats in the room)
4. Room configuration (fixed vs. flexible furniture)
5. Room condition score (values between 1 and 10; 1=poor; 10=great condition)
6. Hours in use (number of hours this room is being scheduled per week)
7. Average occupancy when in use (average percent of seats that are occupied when the classroom is in use)
